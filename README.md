## Standard Workflow

 1. Set up the project: `bin/setup`
 1. Start the web server by clicking "Run Project".
 1. Navigate to your live application preview.
 1. As you work, remember to navigate to `/git` and **commit often as you work.**
 1. Run `rails grade` as often as you like to see how you are doing, but **make sure you test your app manually first to make sure it matches the target's behavior first**.
